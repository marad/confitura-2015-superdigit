# [Confitura 2015](http://tech.viacom.com/warsawsdc/confitura2015/)

## Requirements

To compile this program you need `make` and `ghc` (Haskell compiler) commands in your `PATH`.

## Building

Just run:

> make

# Running

After building you can run the compiled program. It expects exactly one argument:

> ./superdigit 98741

## Superdigit

We define superdigit of an integer x using the following rules:

* If x has only 1 digit, then its superdigit is x.
* Otherwise, the superdigit of x is equal to the superdigit of the digit-sum of x. Here, digit-sum of a number is defined as the sum of its digits.

For example, super digit of 98741 will be calculated as:

```
super-digit(98741) = super-digit(9+8+7+4+1)
                  = super-digit(29)
                  = super-digit(2+9)
                  = super-digit(11)
                  = super-digit(1+1)
                  = super-digit(2)
                  = 2.
```
